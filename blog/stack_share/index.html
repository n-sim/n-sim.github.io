<p>Have you ever wanted to learn a new programming language, framework, or tool for a software project, but didn&rsquo;t know what to choose?</p>

<p>There is an overwhelming number of technologies out there, making it burdensome to find the best one for you to use and learn.
Ascertaining the advantages and disadvantages often proves to be a difficult task. Additionally, you will have to ask yourself questions like: What tool integrations are available? Does this new technology fit in my tech stack? And most importantly: Is this something, that is used in the real world, by real companies (that offer real jobs and pay real money ðŸ˜‰)?</p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://stackshare.io/">stackshare.io</a>!
The core concept is simple: developers and companies share what tech stack they use.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A tech stack is defined as the set of technologies an organization uses to build a web or mobile application. It is a combination of programming languages, frameworks, libraries, patterns, servers, UI/UX solutions, software, and tools used by its developers.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="browsing-stacks">Browsing Stacks</h2>

<p>Under <a href="https://stackshare.io/stacks">Browse Stacks</a>, you can have a look at the stacks of well known companies including Google, Facebook, Dropbox, Spotify, Medium and many others.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say you are curious about <a href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify&rsquo;s</a> tech stack. Just head over to their <a href="https://stackshare.io/shopify/shopify">stackshare page</a> to get an in-depth look:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rtCcji2.png" alt="Shopify" /></p>

<p>At the time of writing, Shopify states to use 19 technologies in the &ldquo;Application and Data&rdquo; category. You can learn more about a particular technology by clicking on it.</p>

<p>Developers are able to share insights on why a particular technology was chosen and any lessons that have been learned. Furthermore, you may ask questions about the stack or the reasons for selecting certain technologies.</p>

<h2 id="a-win-win-situation">A Win-Win situation</h2>

<p>You as a developer can see which technologies are widely used in companies and can therefore decide to learn about and integrate them into your own projects. By familiarizing yourself with in-demand tools, you will become an in-demand job candidate.
You will also gain invaluable insights into the decisions that architects of successful companies make and can benefit from their expertise when it comes to building scalable software products with well-interoperating tools.</p>

<p>Companies, on the other hand, can actively encourage developers to use the tools they use, ensuring that those who are interested in the company have all the necessary skills to hire them.</p>

<p>StackShare has recognized this opportunity and offers companies the ability to list active job openings along with a list of technologies used on the job.</p>

<p>This way, everybody wins.</p>

<h2 id="knowing-your-tools">Knowing your tools</h2>

<p>Suppose you already have a language, framework, software, etc. in mind that you want to learn more about, for example: React. If you type <em>React</em> in the search box, you will find <a href="https://stackshare.io/react">this page</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mtputkY.png" alt="React on stackshare" /></p>

<p>StackShare shows you everything you need to know about React: a description, a list of companies that use it as part of their stack, tools that integrate well with it, its benefits, jobs that require React knowledge, and a collection of popular alternatives.</p>

<p>I consider the last point to be particularly interesting: Knowing about available substitutes is especially useful when it comes to deciding what to use:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rC8o2wX.png" alt="React alternatives" /></p>

<p>StackShare displays a number of related frameworks along with an explanatory paragraph. You will also find links to in-depth comparisons, so-called &ldquo;StackUps&rdquo; (get it? ðŸ¥´).</p>

<h2 id="the-ultimate-aid-to-decision-making">The ultimate aid to decision-making</h2>

<p><a href="https://stackshare.io/stackups/trending">StackUps</a> lets you compare up to three technologies of your choice.
These comparisons are my personal highlight, although it has to be said that comparing HTML to DynamoDB is unlikely to yield any interesting information.</p>

<p>Other comparisons, such as <a href="https://stackshare.io/stackups/react-vs-vue-js">React vs Vue</a> are highly informative. You are presented with numerous popularity metrics, advantages, and disadvantages of each contender, as well as recommendations from experienced developers.</p>

<p>According to their own data, more than one million developers use StackShare. That&rsquo;s a lot of brain power!
To communicate with each other â€” share knowledge, tips or ask for advice, you can create posts:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/hpPeOar.png" alt="Creating a post" /></p>

<p>This way you can check out the thoughts others have had about their technology choices and which conclusions they have come to.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>StackShare has become an indispensable resource for me when learning about new technologies. Its approach of focusing on real-world use cases ensures that you don&rsquo;t have to waste time learning obsolete or unused technologies, but instead focus on things that are actually used in practice.</p>

<p>Whenever I have to choose between two similar technologies, I open StackShare, look at their advantages and disadvantages, which companies are using them respectively, and what other developers have to say about them.</p>

<p>I highly encourage you to check it out.</p>
